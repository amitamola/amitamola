## Hello there! I'm Amit, and welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

* 🤓 Currently, I am a student at Trinity College Dublin, pursuing my second Master's degree in Computer Science.
* 👨‍💻 I am actively seeking full-time opportunities starting from August 2023.
* 🏎️ I consider myself a fast learner and keen observer, with extensive experience in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. However, I'm constantly striving to learn more and wouldn't call myself an expert just yet.
* 📝 I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences with fellow data science practitioners on my 📓[Medium](https://amitamola.medium.com/) blog. I'm in the process of documenting all the new stuff I've learned during my masters.
* 📫 You can reach out to me via:
